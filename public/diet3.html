    <h2>Here Are The Recommended Dietary Precautions</h2>
    <br>
        <p>The goal for growing children is always slowing the rate of weight gain (not weight loss).          </p>
            <ul >
                    <li class="mylist">Try to breast-feed. Breast-fed babies tend to be lighter in weight.</li>
                    <li class="mylist">If you are bottle-feeding, don't allow your child to keep a bottle as a companion during the day or night.</li>
                    <li class="mylist">Don't feed your baby every time she cries. Most crying babies want to be held and cuddled or may be thirsty and just need some water.</li> 
                    <li class="mylist">Avoid solids until your child is 4 months old</li>
                    <li class="mylist">Don't give your child food as a way to distract her or keep her occupied. Instead, give her something to play with when you need some free time.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            </div>
            <br>
              <div id="warn" class="container">
                    Caution: Also don't underfeed your infant. Don't put your baby on low-fat milk or skim milk before 2 years of age. Your baby's brain is growing rapidly and needs the fat content of whole milk. While overfeeding is more common than underfeeding in infancy, underfeeding is more harmful.
